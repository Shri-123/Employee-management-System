# Employee-management-System

INTRODUCTION :
In this project, I have tried to frame the Employee Management System which uses the concept of creating a GUI application using java programming language.
Here, MySQL is used for a data management regarding the information of an employee. 
So, combo of them is used for the basic construction of the project.  
The concepts of java “awt” and “swings” are used as the prime source for creating the various windows as shown below. 
Similarly, the simple SQL are used for the data manipulation in the application. Here, we have created total  classes for every process to run efficiently.

FLOW :
From the front page the execution starts after which we have to login into the system with correct username and password otherwise it displays error message.
Then the details page opens where we have all options to work on application. If we want to add then we have to click add button and by filling details we have to submit.
If want to view the same then click the view button and by passing employee ID we can view it.
Similarly, to update and remove the records we have to click the respective buttons from the details page and by providing specific employee ID 
the entry will be deleted and updated. In this way the whole code runs smoothly and efficiently.
